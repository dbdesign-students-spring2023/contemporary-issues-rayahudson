## Will ChatGPT replace data scientists?

In this document I will be discussing two articles discussing whether the chatbot ChatGPT will replace the jobs of data scientists.

## Article I

Dario Radečić author of the article [ChatGPT - Are Data Science Jobs Now Obsolete?](https://betterdatascience.com/chatgpt/) asks the chatbot a series of questions relating to the field. It was asked to explain the Linear Regression Formula in Machine Learning and write a Machine Learning Model for Predicting Passenger Survival on the Titanic Dataset using a Random Forecast classifier algorithm. Questions asking for an explanation to certain questions, Linear Regression Formula in Machine Learning for example, were answered spot on. Many of the code also provided by ChatGPT were accurate.
Overall, it seems as if ChatGPT is accurate when it comes to providing blocks of code requested by the user. The bot is still in development mode, but based off the answers provided, the bot can become a powerful tool to give to data scientists. The article concludes with, "I don't see ChatGPT making tech professionals obsolete, at least not yet. Instead, I see it as a tool that will eliminate some boring aspects of our jobs." I think that the future of science in general is up to the advancement of chatbots.

## Article II

The article [Why ChatGPT won’t replace humans any time soon](https://www.namecheap.com/blog/why-chatgpt-wont-replace-humans-any-time-soon/) by Cora Quigley assures scientists and workers in general that their job is safe from the chatbot citing it's accuracy, bias towards minorites and sexism, and inability to decipher accurate sources. When asked certain questions the bot was not able to accurately produce written material and think critically enough to form its own arguements.
While it is unclear what the future holds for chatbots and their abilities, it is currently clear that the bots are not advanced enough to replace human workers. This offers some reassurance for scientists and workers in general, as they can rest assured that their jobs are safe from the threat of automation for now.
